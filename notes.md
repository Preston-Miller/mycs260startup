In this GitHub assignment I learned a few things but still have many remaining questions.
This is a brand new software for me, so it may take some time to adjust. 
What I understand right now is that GitHub is a place where I can save, share, and borrow code. 
I can work on the code locally on my computer and can push changes I made up to my Github repository. 
Anyone with access to that repository can then copy the entire thing, and pull updated changes through their terminal. 
That is about the extent of my learning so far but I look forward to becoming more familiar and comfortable with it.


It is always very important to be IN THE DIRECTORY in the console that you are trying to do work with.

CSS Responsive Design Notes:

The CSS display property allows you to change how an HTML element is displayed by the browser. Some common options for this include none, block, inline, flex, and grid. 
Flex displays the element's children in a flexible orientation.
Grid displays the element's children in a grid orientation.
Viewport meta tag allows the responsive design to do the scaling instead of the browser. Always have this at the head of each HTML page: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
@media selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change. 

CSS Grid Notes:

You create a grid by putting a display property with the value of 'grid' on the partent element. 

CSS Flexbox Notes:

You create a flexbox by putting a display property with the value of 'flex' on the parent element. 

Debugging CSS Notes:

If you open up your project on google chrome and hit 'inspect' you can go to the styles tab and see which pieces of css code are affecting which areas of your page.
