In this GitHub assignment I learned a few things but still have many remaining questions.
This is a brand new software for me, so it may take some time to adjust. 
What I understand right now is that GitHub is a place where I can save, share, and borrow code. 
I can work on the code locally on my computer and can push changes I made up to my Github repository. 
Anyone with access to that repository can then copy the entire thing, and pull updated changes through their terminal. 
That is about the extent of my learning so far but I look forward to becoming more familiar and comfortable with it.


It is always very important to be IN THE DIRECTORY in the console that you are trying to do work with.
