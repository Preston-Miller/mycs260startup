# HTML deliverable
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.
- [x] **HTML** pages - Four HTML pages: a home page, talking page, notifications page, and about page.
- [x] **Links** - All HTML pages contain navigation to each other, the login/create account buttons also links the user to the chat page.
- [x] **Text** - There is textual content throughout the entire startup, most importantly represented in the messages sent and recieved on the talk page, and the information on the about page.
- [x] **Images** - I will have a rotating image on the about page, powered by a third party service. It is currently held by a placeholder.
- [x] **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The messages sent and recieved as well as the notifications represent data pulled from the database.
- [x] **WebSocket** - The realtime communication will be taking place in both the message center on the talk page as well as the notifications on the updates page.
